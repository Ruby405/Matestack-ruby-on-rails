# Community

We're happy about every single active community member. Asking questions, creating GitHub Issues, adjusting things through PRs... every kind of community activity counts!

## Discord server

Once started with a Gitter chat, we moved to a Discord server in November 2020. Join [here](https://discord.gg/c6tQxFG) in order to get support while creating awesome stuff with Matestack! Happy to see you there!

## Weekly Q/A sessions

In order to help you with any issues around Matestack, we offer free, personal Q/A sessions two times a week:

* Tuesday, 10 AM CET
* Thursday, 6 PM CET

  Join [here](https://discord.gg/c6tQxFG) to get the links to the video calls, shared a bit in advance of each Q/A session.
