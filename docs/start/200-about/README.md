# About Matestack

## Who we are

We are a small team of passionated Ruby developers commited to put everything we have into creating sustainable Ruby gems simplifying web software development for developers around the world. The core members of our team are Nils and Jonas working from Dresden and Berlin, Germany. Jonas as the founder of the company is working full time at matestack. Nils contributes as a working stundent part time and writes his master's thesis about matestack's technology. In February 2021 he wants to join full time! We're Ruby developers but take different roles at the company: Jonas once created the first versions of `matestack-ui-core` starting in 2018 but has now transitioned to handling business, management, sales and marketing. Nils joined 2020 and is now taking the engineering lead role, managing our tech development.

We are a bootstrapped company offering software development/consulting services to our clients and at the same time creating open source Ruby gems. The revenue earned from our services is used to invest more time implementing and maintaining our gems. We do not get money from investors.

## Why we do what we do

We are passionated Ruby developers. In specific: we love to create web applications based on Ruby On Rails.

In order to create dynamic, app-like web applications, we once started to create fullblown JavaScript applications and reduced Rails to a pure JSON API. Using this common approach, compared to the classic single-repo MVC structure, we increased the complexity in our development by introducing a separate full-blown frontend framework. Implementing two separate systems (backend-api, frontend-app) is a pain: Two different code bases, two repositories to maintain, two different deployment schedules, two test environments, two everything...! And then add native app development for iOS and Android on top of that! Being a small dev team, we decided not to adopt this modern web development complexity and decided to create... `matestack-ui-core`!

`matestack-ui-core` enables us to define sophisticated UI behavior in pure Ruby without touching JavaScript and HTML. We end up writing 50% less code while increasing productivity, maintainability and developer happiness. We love it and want to share that gift with other Ruby developers around the world.

The main goals are:

- Reduction of complexity of modern web development, moving front and backend closer together
- More maintainable UI code, using a component-based structure written in Ruby
- Increased development speed and happiness, offering prebuilt UI-Components for typical requirements
- Modern, dynamic UI feeling without the need to implement a separate JavaScript Application
