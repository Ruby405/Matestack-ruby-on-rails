# Matestack UI Core Docs

Welcome to the docs of the Ruby gem `matestack-ui-core`, enabling you to easily create component based (reactive) web UIs in pure Ruby on top of your Rails applications.

The docs cover following main topics:

- Installation and general information
- UI components in pure Ruby
- Reactive components in pure Ruby
- Reactive apps in pure Ruby


## [Installation](/docs/core/start/100-installation/)

Learn how to properly set up and update matestack-ui-core with your existing Rails application.

## [UI components in pure Ruby](/docs/core/ui_components/README.md)

Craft your UI based on your components written in pure Ruby. Utilizing Ruby's amazing language features, you're able to create a cleaner and more maintainable UI implementation.

## [Reactive components in pure Ruby](/docs/core/reactive_components/README.md)

What about going even one step further and implement **REACTIVE** UIs in pure Ruby? Matestack's reactive core components can be used with a simple Ruby DSL enabling you to create reactive UIs without touching JavaScript!

## [Reactive apps in pure Ruby](/docs/core/reactive_apps/README.md)

The last step in order to leverage the full Matestack power: Create app (~Rails layout) and page (Rails ~view) classes and implement dynamic page transitions without any JavaScript implementation required.
