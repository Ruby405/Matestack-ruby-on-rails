# Matestack UI Core Docs

Welcome to the docs of the Ruby gem `matestack-ui-core`!

Matestack enables you to craft maintainable web UIs in pure Ruby, skipping ERB and HTML. UI code becomes a native and fun part of your Rails app. Thanks to reactive core components, reactivity can be optionally added on top without writing JavaScript, just using a simple Ruby DSL.

You end up writing 50% less code while increasing productivity, maintainability and developer happiness. Work with pure Ruby. If necessary, extend with pure JavaScript. No Opal involved.

The docs cover following main topics:

**[Installation](/docs/start/100-installation/)**

Learn how to properly set up and update matestack-ui-core with your existing Rails application.

**[UI components in pure Ruby](/docs/ui_components/README.md)**

Craft your UI based on your components written in pure Ruby. Utilizing Ruby's amazing language features, you're able to create a cleaner and more maintainable UI implementation.

**[Reactive components in pure Ruby](/docs/reactive_components/README.md)**

*Optional feature*

What about going even one step further and implement **REACTIVE** UIs in pure Ruby? Matestack's reactive core components can be used with a simple Ruby DSL enabling you to create reactive UIs without touching JavaScript!

**[Reactive apps in pure Ruby](/docs/reactive_apps/README.md)**

*Optional feature*

The last step in order to leverage the full Matestack power: Create app (~Rails layout) and page (Rails ~view) classes and implement dynamic page transitions without any JavaScript implementation required.
