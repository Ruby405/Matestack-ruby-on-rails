# Guides overview
Welcome to the `matestack-ui-core` guides! In here, we cover various use cases of this library, along with examples and explanations.

If you need in-depth explanations of how things work, head to the [docs](/docs/README.md)

## Installation
Learn how to properly set up `matestack-ui-core` with your existing Rails application - we cover both the AssetPipeline and Webpacker [in this guide](/docs/guides/1-installation/README.md).

## Essential Guide
In this series, we start by creating a new Rails app and then expand it by installing `matestack-ui-core`, deploying it to Heroku and adding basic CRUD functionality, diving deeper on a couple of (mostly `matestack`-related) topics.

This guide is split into 10 parts, each building onto the changes of the previous one. It is meant to be used as a work-along orientation where you can change various parts according to your likings.

You can start with [the first article](/docs/guides/2-essential/00_introduction.md).

## Contribute
If you're looking into contributing to this project, please take a look at the [Contribution Guide](/docs/guides/13-contribute/) - there, we cover everything from guidelines to basic concepts and the local development setup.

## Miscellaneous
Even though we try to keep things simple from an API perspective for you (the developer), things can get tricky and/or there are specific requirements in your projects that call for sophisticated solutions!

The [miscellaneous guides](/docs/guides/12-miscellaneous/README.md) collect a variety of those cases and are meant both as an inspiration and first address of support.

If you don't find what you were looking for, feel free to [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/matestack/matestack-ui-core/issues/new) and/or [ask for community support](mailto:jonas@matestack.io).

If you happen to have a case that you feel belongs here, you are more than welcome to [open a PR](https://github.com/matestack/matestack-ui-core/compare)!
