# Guides overview

Welcome to the `matestack-ui-core` guides! In here, we cover various use cases of this library, along with examples and explanations.

**Note:**
These guides/docs are written for `>= 1.1.0`. If you're looking for the docs for older releases, please have a look at the github repo itself within `/docs` and select the desired version tag.

## Installation

Learn how to properly set up `matestack-ui-core` with your existing Rails application - we cover both the AssetPipeline and Webpacker [in this guide](/docs/guides/000-installation/README.md).


## [Tutorial](/docs/guides/100-tutorial/)

These series of guides introduces you to matestack step by step. We start of by creating a rails app and subsequently implement a basic CRUD app using matestack. Afterwards we dive deeper into matestacks functionalities giving you a great starting point and a good introduction. At the end we provide guides on how to work with devise and deploy your application to heroku.

This guide is split into several parts building upon each other. It is intended to be a work along guide. Feel free to adapt things to your needs.

You can start with [the first article](/docs/guides/100-tutorial/00_introduction.md).

## [Basic building blocks](/docs/guides/200-basic_building_blocks/README.md)

Our basic building blocks guide teaches you the concepts of matestack, including apps, pages, components and the event hub. It provides you with an overview of what they are, what they can be used for and how they work. At the end we present to you core features of matestack, giving you an idea of what you can achieve with matestack with ease and without writing anything else than ruby.
