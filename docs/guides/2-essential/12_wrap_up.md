# Essential Guide 10: Wrap Up & Outlook
Welcome to the final part of the 10-step-guide of setting up a working Rails CRUD app with `matestack-ui-core`!

## Quick recap
What have we got so far? After following the previous 9 articles, there's now a `RubyOnRails` application running on `Heroku`, allowing for basic CRUD operations.

We have achieved this by setting up two `matestack` apps each with some `matestack` pages, and by orchestrating a collection of **core** and **custom** `matestack` components, both *static* and *dynamic* ones.

One of the `matestack` apps is only available after an admin has logged in and protected by the `Devise` gem. The application pleases the eye since we have set up and customized `Bootstrap`. Assets are being served by `Webpacker`.

What now?

## Be proud
Pat yourself on the shoulder - you've made it until here, and it was quite a journey! Make sure to push your code to a GitLab or GitHub repository so it will survive a possible change of computers.

## Customize your application
In this guide, we have followed a quite strict and pre-defined route. Now is the time for you to take over and change it according to your ideas!

## Further reading
