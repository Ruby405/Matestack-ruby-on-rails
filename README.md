# matestack-ui-core

## Escape the frontend hustle & easily create interactive web apps in pure Ruby

`matestack-ui-core` is a Rails engine for Ruby on Rails developers.

`matestack-ui-core` enables you to craft interactive web UIs without JavaScript in pure Ruby with minimum effort.
UI code becomes a native and fun part of your Rails app.

Work with pure Ruby. If necessary, extend with pure JavaScript. No Opal involved.

The main goals are:

- Reduction of complexity of modern web development, moving front and backend closer together
- More maintainable UI code, using a component-based structure written in Ruby
- Increased development speed and happiness, offering prebuilt UI-Components for typical requirements
- Modern, dynamic UI feeling without the need to implement a separate JavaScript Application

`matestack-ui-core` can progressively replace the classic Rails-View-Layer. You are able to use
it alongside your classic views and incrementally turn your Rails-App into a
dynamic Web-App.
